# Image-Restoration-Metrics
This is a code library that contains the calculation of metrics for various image restoration tasks. Specifically, it includes Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and Frechet Inception Distance (FID).  

Specifically, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure) are implemented using the `skimage.metrics` library, LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) is implemented using the `lpips` library, and FID (Frechet Inception Distance) is implemented using `pytorch_fid`. The calculation of each metric is standardized and efficient.
